Pico SQLite
------------

A very tiny (pico?) sqlite viewer designed for educational
purpose.

The sqlite3 command-line interface is too low-level for beginners
whereas most viewers available are too features full and may be
confusing for newcomers.

Pico SQLite is a Tk-based command-line interface with a table, schema,
and query result viewer.

# Features
- Minimal Tk-based GUI
- Only depends on Python 3.7+
- Schema and table viewer with support for large tables thanks to rows
  lazy loading.
- Query runner and result viewer
- Script runner
- Syntax highlighting
- Active transaction indicator
