Pico SQLite
------------

A very tiny (pico?) sqlite viewer designed for educational
purpose. The sqlite3 command-line interface is too low-level for
beginners whereas most viewers out-there are too feature full which
may be confusing.

Pico SQLite is a Tk-based command-line interface with a table and
schema viewer.

# Features
- Tk-based GUI
- Only depends on Python 3.7+
- Schema and data viewer
- Query runner and result viewer
- Script runner
- Lazy data loading

# Installation

Just copy the Python script and run it.
