Second non-beta release

New features since v1.0.1:

- Main "Database" menu has been split into three menus including two new menus
  "View" and "Console".

- On Windows, the console window is hidden at startup.

- The Python version number is now shown in the about dialog box.

- SQL strings are now highlighted.

- Color for syntax highlighting has been adjusted to improve readability and
  properly support dark/light theme.

- An activity log is written in the local user data. A menu item has been added
  to easily open the directory are log files are stored.

- A new .drop_all_tables internal directive has been added.

- None values are now shown as an empty cell.

- The CLI now accepts a query to be run when the program starts up.

- The "Run query" menu item is disabled/enabled the same way the "Run" button
  in the console window is disabled/enabled.

- The "Clear result" menu item has been renamed to "Close result tab" for better
  clarity.


Bug fix since v1.0.1:

- In some circumstances, inserted value did not appear in the view. This was
  due to incorrectly handled interleaved fetch requests. The way we insert
  fetched rows in the view is now more tolerant to overlapping windows, and thus,
  is more robust to handle interleaved fetch requests which are now allowed.

- Un-caught exceptions are now written in the log file and the user.

- Prevent the console window to close before the user has a chance to read
 un-caught exceptions on Windows.

- Properly warn against uncommitted data when quitting.

- Properly convert NULL SQL's value type to None value type in Python.  We now
  fallback to None if we do not understand the SQL's value type.

- No longer mangle string value using Python representation which is not the
  same as SQL's string representation.

- Row deletion now works even if the primary key is not the first column.


Refactoring:

- Many warnings related to code formatting and documentation has been fixed.

- The code for lazy data loading has been commented, clarified and refactored.

- Explicitly use UTF-8 when opening files on all platform.
