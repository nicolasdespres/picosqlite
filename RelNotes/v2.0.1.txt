Bug fix release

Bug fix since v2.0.0:

- Table names and field names are no longer highlighted. Although this
  feature works great with SELECT query, it can be confusing for beginners
  when writing CREATE TABLE queries, since some fields may be highlighted
  (if present in other tables) whereas others may not.

- Fix the respawn mechanism on some weirdly configured Windows machine where
  os.execv does not respawn the application.

Refactoring:

- English in documentation improved and extended in various ways.

- No longer print twice un-caught exceptions.
