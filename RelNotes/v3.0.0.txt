Features drop release.

User visible changes:

- Remove detailed view: this view goes in the opposite direction of the project's
  minimal philosophy to force student to use SQL instruction instead of clicking

- Remove 'delete rows' menu item for the same reason.

- Include log content in internal error window.

Bug fix since v2.0.3:

- More robust vtype value handling.

- PicoSQLite and Python version are included in the log.

Refactoring:

- Introduce a specific error hierarchy for directive error and use it instead
  of RuntimeError.
